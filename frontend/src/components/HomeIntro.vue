      AIFMRMâ€™s Equity Risk Service is a continuation of the same service previously offered by BNP Paribas
Securities South Africa (Pty) Ltd (BNP). This service is aimed at providing up-to-date risk measures and
associated statistics for the stocks and indices that are listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).
The Equity Risk Service is based not only on the American and the British experience but also on an
ongoing research programme at the University of Cape Town (UCT). The estimates are based on a price
and volume series database sourced from the JSE Ltd, Bloomberg L.P. and INET BFA - IRESS.
