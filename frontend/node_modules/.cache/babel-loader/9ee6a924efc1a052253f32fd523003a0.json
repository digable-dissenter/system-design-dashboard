If, however, a share has not been traded at a respective\n      month-end, the aforementioned returns are computed between last and\n      previous trade dates - this is the thin trading adjustment. If one were to\n      plot these points with the index’s returns on the horizontal axis and the\n      share’s returns on the vertical axis, beta would be the slope of the line\n      that best fits these points.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Could you estimate beta?</h2>\n    <p>\n      There is no reason why not. One would, however, need a time-series of both\n      the share returns, volumes as well as the market index returns. Be careful\n      though, as there are some techniques which can make all the difference\n      between good and bad estimates. This service implements techniques that\n      improve beta estimation, especially for thinly-traded shares. On this\n      basis, it’s advisable and prudent to use the beta estimates provided by\n      this service. Should more information be required in this regard, please\n      contact the relevant contact person at AIFMRM.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>What estimation periods are used?</h2>\n    <p>\n      Every quarter, the last five years of monthly returns are utilised, which\n      is the last 60 data points. Research has shown that the trade-off between\n      the desire to include more data points and concerns about the stationarity\n      of beta point to five years of data as being most reasonable. It should\n      also be noted that using daily or even weekly prices to maximise the\n      number of data points is futile as it introduces considerable noise\n      (error) that can introduce significantly biased estimates.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      In the beta tables, some of the more recently listed companies have less\n      than 60 data points that were used in the estimation procedure. It is\n      advisable that the betas of these companies are used with caution,\n      especially if there are less than about 40 data points indicated in the\n      column headed ‘# Points’.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Are betas stable?</h2>\n    <p>\n      Betas do change! The major causes for the changes in a company’s beta are\n      linked to a shift in the debt-to-equity ratio of a company or a shift in\n      the risk of the projects that the company undertakes.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Do betas differ in bull and bear markets?</h2>\n    <p>\n      It would be nice if they did, unfortunately research suggests that they\n      don’t. However, we would be interested to know if you find a company with\n      a beta that does!\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>A share with a high beta, declined while the market rose?</h2>\n    <p>\n      It is relatively easy to find many shares that did likewise. This\n      occurrence is simply due to the fact that such shares have high unique\n      risk. Consequently, these shares would have exhibited a large negative\n      abnormal return over the particular period. Recall that for any single\n      share only a part of the variability (total risk) is due to market\n      movements. By combining shares into portfolios, their unique risks are\n      diversified away, and it is unlikely that such declines would have been\n      significant in the portfolio context.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>How will trading shares affect a portfolio’s risk?</h2>\n    <p>\n      Assuming the existing portfolio is diversified, the beta of the portfolio\n      is the primary measure that determines the risk of the portfolio.\n      Consequently, only the beta of the company being traded can influence the\n      risk of the portfolio. One can determine the effect of the additional\n      share on the portfolio’s risk by remembering that the beta of the\n      portfolio is simply the weighted average of its constituent betas.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Why the emphasis on beta, if it’s not conclusive?</h2>\n    <p>\n      Most individuals attempt to hold diversified portfolios to reduce unique\n      risk. However, they know that their shares are tied together by a web of\n      co-movements that determine the limit of the diversification benefits.\n      This limit is determined by the market risk of their portfolio, and its\n      beta precisely determines the sensitivity of the portfolio to market\n      movements.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>What exactly are R&sup2; and 1 − R&sup2;</h2>\n    <p>\n      Technically, the R&sup2; indicates how well the “best fitting” regression\n      line “fits” the data points. Interpreting this in a more useful way, it\n      tells one what proportion of the share’s movement is due to market\n      movements, i.e. the proportion of market risk relative to total risk.\n      Clearly then, 1 − R&sup2; tells one what proportion of the share’s\n      movement is due to unique factors, i.e. 1 − R&sup2; measures the\n      proportion of unique risk relative to total risk.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Annual to monthly standard deviation/volatility?</h2>\n    <p>\n      The standard deviations (or volatilities) provided in the tables are calculated on a monthly basis, and then\n      annualised. Hence, a standard deviation of 48.5% should be interpreted as\n      48.5% per annum. To convert this into monthly terms, simply divide the\n      published figure by the square root of 12, i.e. (48.5%) /\n      <span>\n        <span style=\"vertical-align: 16%\">&radic;</span>\n        <span style=\"text-decoration: overline\"> 12 </span>\n      </span>\n      = 14% per month.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n\n\nimport HeaderCode from './HeaderCode.vue'\nexport default {\n  name: 'FaqPage',\n    components: {HeaderCode,\n    }\n}\n</script>\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
